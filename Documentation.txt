Documentation:

This is a very simple to use tool, read this document in case you have any doubts.

* The scripts contained in the tool are easily accesed by unfolding the S-Lines.Spline DLL
	Drag them to the inspector whenever you want to use them.

	- Spline_Frame 		=> (Creates a spline when added to a gameobject)
	- Spline_Node 		=> (Don't use it directly)
	- Spline_Itr 		=> (Use it to traverse the spline)
	- Spline_Update 	=> (Keeps the (Itr)s updated when the Spline Frame changes)
	- Spline_Draw 		=> (Draws a trail render along the spline)

	Dont use any of the scripts insisde the S-Lines.Frame DLL

* To create a Spline drag to the inspector the Spline_Frame script. It will create the first node 
for you, but in order to keep editing select the node.

* You can select the nodes (Inside the Spline_Node inspector)
	-> directly in the spline
	-> in the spline_frame inspector
	-> by opening the gameObject that contains the node

	Use the editor to create the spline path that you want
	Use the inspector to change the node mode {Free, Aligned, Mirrored, Auto, Poly}
	Use the {Duplicate} button to duplicate the current node
		-> its the only way of extending the spline
	Use the {Remove} button to remove the current node
		-> dont delete the gameObject directly: it can cause problems;

* Spline_Itr is the script that contains the iteration in the spline. Use it to move
a gameObject along the curve, but to do it in game mode (automatically) you need to attach a Script_Mover.

	->The distance {parameter that describes the iteration state} represents the acumalated distance
	from the start of the spline.

* Script_Mover makes the Script_Itr work in game mode, and Handles.

	Specify the direction that you want
		-> Forward
		-> Backward
	Use the following modes for different movement
		-> Loop
		-> Ping-Pong
		-> Stop

EVENTS: use the different events in the scripts to comunicate with your scripts, this way you can 
create your own specific actions for events such as:

	-> OnSplineChanged 	: (Spline_Frame)
	-> OnReachEnd 		: (Spline_Itr)
	-> OnReachStart 	: (Spline_Itr)
