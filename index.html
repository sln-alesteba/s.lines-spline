                <p>
                In order to create a new Spline -> go to the unity toolbar -> S-Lines/Spline.
                A new game object will be created with their correspondent scripts.

                <h2>Spline Frame</h2>

                <p>
                This is the main component for editing and extending the spline. In order to edit the spline click on its 
                correspondent nodes and drag them wherever you need them to be, this way you can create any path you want.
                To make it easier for editing, the only way to add new nodes, is to duplicate the selected one, click the 
                button inside its editor (each node is a different gameObject).
                </p>

                <img src="img/spline_frame_base.png" alt="Spline Base" class="center">

                <h3>Architecture</h3>

                <p>
                    It is interesting to know that each nod is contained in a different gameObject. 
                    They are connected in a linked list structure for fast iteration and easy CRUD {Create, Read, Update, Delete} operations.
                    This spline architecture allows to create simple script extensions. 
                    For example a single node could be moved at runtime in a wavy oscillation movement 
                    (a script is needed to achieve this behavior).
                </p>

                <h3>Editing</h3>

                <p>
                On the scene view the spline is renderer with a thin curve line and the nodes are represented as white dots.
                You can select the nodes:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>directly in the spline</li>
                    <li>in the spline_frame inspector</li>
                    <li>by opening the gameObject that contains the node</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Use the regular unity transform tool to drag the nodes anywhere you need them.</p>

                <h3>Toolbar</h3>

                <p>
                    The Toolbar at the top of the component includes some of the basic editing options. 
                </p>

                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Button</th>
                        <th>Action</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><</td>
                        <td>Select the first node</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>></td>
                        <td>Select the last node</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>R</td>
                        <td>Reset the spline</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>+</td>
                        <td>Duplicate the last node</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                
                <h3>Closed</h3>

                <p>
                The spline can be either open or closed. Many times closed path are needed, and when this is the case,
                the rest of the components that depend directly on the spline shape will be notified in their behavior.
                </p>

                <h3>Node List</h3>

                <p>
                The inspector allows the view of all of the child nodes that conform the spline.
                Any of them can be selected from here and the current GameObject selection will be modified.
                </p>

                <h3>Events</h3>

                <p>
                There are a few interesting events we might want to interact with such as when the shape of the spline is changed.
                The tool supports the unity event property and allows a easy integration with the user scripts. 
                </p>

                <h3>Extensions</h3>

                <p>
                Within the Spline_Frame component you can create new behavior for the line, such as drawers or traversals.
                In order to add a new extension component select the one you need on the "extend" view in the inspector.
                </p>

                    <tr>

                <p>
                    You can modify each individual node of the spline. There are a few interesting options in each of them.

                Along with the node selection tools creates a nice user experience.

                    Use the {Remove} button to remove the current node, don't delete the gameObject directly: it can cause problems;
